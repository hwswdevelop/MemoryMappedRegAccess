# MemoryMappedRegAccess
C++ optimezed safe access to memory mapped register (prototyping)

So, I tried to prototype different register access...
Is it possible to make it safe?
Is it possible to optimize assembler instructions count?
Is it possible to assert on wrong bitfiled description (some cases)?
Is it possible to make type checking?
Is it possible to make soft change of register width or bus addrss width?
Is it possible to add memory barrier instructions, by changing one parametr?

Yes, it is....
